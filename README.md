# Create_a_dynamic_dashboard_with_Power_BI_to_visualize_projects_progress

<h1>I. Context</h1>

I did a dataviz consulting mission in **Sanitorial**, an international company who made and sell oral cares.

This firm needed a dynamic dashboard to follow projects progress, identify delays and monitor performance so that the team can take appropriate actions.

The dynamic dashboard needed to contain three roles with different authorization levels (CEO, Region Manager & Country Manager)

<h1>II. Methodology</h1>
  <h2>1. Doing a Product Strategy Canvas (PSC) </h2>
    <li>Create a PSC based on a provided template in order to ensure that I had understood customer needs</li>
    <li>Writing users stories to describe each roles and authorization levels</li>

  <h2>2. Preparing data</h2>
    <li>Opening files in Power Query Editor to prepare data</li>
    <li>Link tables to perform cross-analysis</li>
    <li>Design a data warehouse with a star model</li>
    
  <h2>3. Develop the final dynamic dashboard</h2>
    <li>Using DAX language to highlight delay or budget troubles</li>
    <li>Set up roles and authorization levels by using filter rules on data</li>
    <li>Create visualization of Key Performance Indicators (KPI)</li>

  <h2>4. Presentation of results</h2>
    <li>Present the dashboard to the project manager </li>
